first please take a moment to review our


about 24 to 48 hours I'll be sharing the




thank you so much Albina as always for


he he wasn't on the


have heard of it so no one better than


you take out with the reactor too as


little bit more about utilizing Linux on


freaking cool anyway


are based off of like Linux images so if


reasoning or can you give me like a


people is at so that's super




which is called reactor demo


be running


videos uh I think the longest one might


think this is going to provision okay
okay there's someone in the chat who


like networking programming


how things boot like you don't it's


this uh our y-axis and then the level of


it's like a managed service but you


in any Cloud it doesn't really matter I


uh in like two hours or so and then


simulated with like software but I know


because ultimately like the program
example uh vs code Docker kubernetes SQL


um but yeah so you say that it it can't


agree yeah that's why I was trying to


think so yeah yeah like bash is like


one is better you shouldn't learn the


stuff that I like so bash uh Azure and


high level of talking about like open


um but


but there might be some gray area with


two are very important too typically


yeah yeah have you seen that I think I


organizations that do utilize open


I joined to Microsoft about a year and a


this like the culture was completely


or with Microsoft in general like what


yeah


probably get a lot more information


yeah our position against open source


it's just like not the right move from


they grabbed.net and they pulled a lot


like there's multiple things that


you start to think like the AWS market


is open source and the.net Foundation is


build as well which I think is important


Community has always been that part of


about all about getting started with WSL


um if you didn't know if you don't know


native Computing Foundation cncf which


let's move around here


don't know why I still get the feeling


Adam had like a really great had some


still easy like because the other Ides I
acquisition and I open Visual Studio and


that where where Visual Studio is like a


ubuntu-based distribution yes snap yep


choco yeah choco yeah yeah there might


embracing the ones that the majority of


bunch of like Windows technology and


and this whole like right shift in


uh


any kind of creative uh migrations it


and over 47 000 customers using Azure


in terms of leveraging Linux let me


this technology in Azure you don't have


you then kind of move your way down the


um I'm pretty sure there's a lot of


typically end up utilizing VMS for that


and then I'm going to use open up my


oh my goodness there's so many oh no


straightforward not a straightforward


that is you know as a way to interacts


then they came up with this awesome


based off Linux right


fix blog post I just want to see how it


and then we create like shopping I don't


this hold on how do I move this can I no






let's grab a shopping one let's grab


uh yeah and I didn't do anything all I


Docker running so


going to see like yeah type like Linux


um


bicep but I don't know if it creates






we know the most because you know if you


learner Cloud uh it is an open source


people maintaining this website on our


know best performant uh SEO optimized


only for February and we are just




maintain this with very very little uh


past I don't know we'll take a look at




we're gonna do last seven days so


here this is actually the API so what


Cloud definition uh it calls the API
um I forgot to close my window that's


through essentially the


sort of like a road map or a guide right


how do you break this down some


there's no charge this isn't a boot camp


individual projects if you want to get


so let's go in here


people if it's like a personal site or


think so yeah you have additional costs


with just things that we're working on


um and that's why it's looking like very


several languages yes English French


um the for a close folder


I believe there's like 2 000 minutes uh


branch you know that's a release and we


know that runs on and Ubuntu container


project because we don't want that and


aren't familiar diff containers another


maybe like one of the best examples is


on board and clone the repo and like


we're using uh Linux once again for our


the well we have an endpoint to create a


from somewhere else and I'll be like I




the adding it to the you know


pretty sick uh that pretty much covers


are talking about can we make sure to


in the bottom right so starting vs code


Windows because it's yeah I mean it is


that in the next session which is the
um I saw something about um and


amount of tokens 4K per per query the


Bing like I was I saw the email today I


need but why would you want to like


pretty sure many many more


we will have hold on let me share we


uh so the first one is just introducing


um you can switch to the bash shell on


commands how to list content how to find


filtering out that that is the beauty in


there too


that as well here and then we put it all


expect this from Microsoft it's like


already that said that they're into the

so let's go in here


people if it's like a personal site or


think so yeah you have additional costs


with just things that we're working on


um and that's why it's looking like very


several languages yes English French


um the for a close folder


I believe there's like 2 000 minutes uh


branch you know that's a release and we


know that runs on and Ubuntu container


project because we don't want that and


aren't familiar diff containers another


maybe like one of the best examples is


on board and clone the repo and like


we're using uh Linux once again for our


the well we have an endpoint to create a


from somewhere else and I'll be like I




the adding it to the you know


pretty sick uh that pretty much covers


are talking about can we make sure to


in the bottom right so starting vs code


Windows because it's yeah I mean it is


that in the next session which is the
um I saw something about um and


amount of tokens 4K per per query the


Bing like I was I saw the email today I


need but why would you want to like


pretty sure many many more


we will have hold on let me share we


uh so the first one is just introducing


um you can switch to the bash shell on


commands how to list content how to find


filtering out that that is the beauty in


there too


that as well here and then we put it all


expect this from Microsoft it's like


already that said that they're into the

about 24 to 48 hours I'll be sharing the




thank you so much Albina as always for


he he wasn't on the


have heard of it so no one better than


you take out with the reactor too as


little bit more about utilizing Linux on


freaking cool anyway


are based off of like Linux images so if


reasoning or can you give me like a


people is at so that's super




which is called reactor demo


be running


videos uh I think the longest one might


think this is going to provision okay
okay there's someone in the chat who


like networking programming


how things boot like you don't it's


this uh our y-axis and then the level of


it's like a managed service but you


in any Cloud it doesn't really matter I


uh in like two hours or so and then


simulated with like software but I know


because ultimately like the program
example uh vs code Docker kubernetes SQL


um but yeah so you say that it it can't


agree yeah that's why I was trying to


think so yeah yeah like bash is like


one is better you shouldn't learn the


stuff that I like so bash uh Azure and


high level of talking about like open


um but


but there might be some gray area with


two are very important too typically


yeah yeah have you seen that I think I


organizations that do utilize open


I joined to Microsoft about a year and a


this like the culture was completely


or with Microsoft in general like what


yeah


probably get a lot more information


yeah our position against open source


it's just like not the right move from


they grabbed.net and they pulled a lot


like there's multiple things that


you start to think like the AWS market


is open source and the.net Foundation is


build as well which I think is important


Community has always been that part of


about all about getting started with WSL


um if you didn't know if you don't know


native Computing Foundation cncf which


let's move around here


don't know why I still get the feeling


Adam had like a really great had some


still easy like because the other Ides I
acquisition and I open Visual Studio and


that where where Visual Studio is like a


ubuntu-based distribution yes snap yep


choco yeah choco yeah yeah there might


embracing the ones that the majority of


bunch of like Windows technology and


and this whole like right shift in


uh


any kind of creative uh migrations it


and over 47 000 customers using Azure


in terms of leveraging Linux let me


this technology in Azure you don't have


you then kind of move your way down the


um I'm pretty sure there's a lot of


typically end up utilizing VMS for that


and then I'm going to use open up my


oh my goodness there's so many oh no


straightforward not a straightforward


that is you know as a way to interacts


then they came up with this awesome


based off Linux right


fix blog post I just want to see how it


and then we create like shopping I don't


this hold on how do I move this can I no






let's grab a shopping one let's grab


uh yeah and I didn't do anything all I


Docker running so


going to see like yeah type like Linux


um


bicep but I don't know if it creates






we know the most because you know if you


learner Cloud uh it is an open source


people maintaining this website on our


know best performant uh SEO optimized


only for February and we are just




maintain this with very very little uh

we're gonna do last seven days so


here this is actually the API so what

and over 47 000 customers using Azure


in terms of leveraging Linux let me


this technology in Azure you don't have


you then kind of move your way down the


um I'm pretty sure there's a lot of


typically end up utilizing VMS for that


and then I'm going to use open up my


oh my goodness there's so many oh no


straightforward not a straightforward


that is you know as a way to interacts


then they came up with this awesome


based off Linux right


fix blog post I just want to see how it


and then we create like shopping I don't


this hold on how do I move this can I no






let's grab a shopping one let's grab


uh yeah and I didn't do anything all I


Docker running so


going to see like yeah type like Linux


um


bicep but I don't know if it creates






we know the most because you know if you


learner Cloud uh it is an open source


people maintaining this website on our


know best performant uh SEO optimized


only for February and we are just




maintain this with very very little uh


past I don't know we'll take a look at




we're gonna do last seven days so


here this is actually the API so what


Cloud definition uh it calls the API
um I forgot to close my window that's


through essentially the

there's no charge this isn't a boot camp


individual projects if you want to get

branch you know that's a release and we


know that runs on and Ubuntu container


project because we don't want that and


aren't familiar diff containers another


maybe like one of the best examples is


on board and clone the repo and like


we're using uh Linux once again for our


the well we have an endpoint to create a


from somewhere else and I'll be like I




the adding it to the you know


pretty sick uh that pretty much covers


are talking about can we make sure to


in the bottom right so starting vs code


Windows because it's yeah I mean it is


that in the next session which is the
um I saw something about um and


amount of tokens 4K per per query the


Bing like I was I saw the email today I
