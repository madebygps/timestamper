our speaker Gwen


and our guest reshap as well welcome


thank you so much Albina as always for


the wonderful introduction hi everyone I


see a couple people in the chat hanging


out with us already awesome let us know


where you are checking in uh also do let


me know if you are on our our session


last week where we talked all about how


Linux works and today we're going to


take it a step further and talk a little


bit about more about utilizing Linux on


Azure and I have my friend rishab here


he he wasn't on the


let's switch to this so he wasn't on the


um


like the series information or the page


or when you register you probably didn't


see his name because last minute I was


like I really want to talk about uh an


app that we have in production that is


utilizing Linux and it's on Azure and


it's an effort by both of us it's called


learn a cloud some of you may or may not


have heard of it so no one better than


talk about these things with than


himself so hey Richard how you doing


I'm doing good I'm doing good and I


guess most of the people no one says is


the duo right the cloud Duo so we do a


lot together yeah yeah


um yeah we are back


um and I think this is my first reactor


stream for this year


oh wow I'm I'm honored yeah you do uh no


you take out with the reactor too as


well rishab does a whole bunch of other


stuff now with me


um but yeah for today uh I want to dive


a little bit more onto Linux on Azure


we're going to talk a little bit more


about Open Source and then the history


of Open Source at Microsoft which was


pretty interesting to read about


um but we're gonna keep these things at


high level then we're gonna talk a


little bit more about utilizing Linux on


Azure then we're gonna demo a little bit


about uh again showcasing our use of


Linux on Azure and then also I want to


actually I'm gonna do this right now


because this might take a while so are


you all familiar with the Azure


developer CLI Azure developer seal I


don't know if anyone's used it before


um also I just got access to the the


Bing chat thing with uh open AI nice so


freaking cool anyway


um so the Azure developer CLI is it's a


CLI that will enable you to essentially


deploy full-on


production ready applications to Azure


with a simple command and they have a


bunch of templates I asked um Savannah


who is the PM for the Azure developer


CLI because I know a lot of their


templates are I want to open up one of


these templates a lot of their templates


are based off of like Linux images so if


we look on like sushi sharp I know the


these app service ones are based off


Linux images and I know the one for the


c-sharp and Azure functions is also


because I helped author that one but


they also have like Java and OJ node.js


Python and I want to pick I don't know


let's pick this Java one as an example


it's off based off container apps and I


asked her like well so what was the


reasoning or can you give me like a


statement because I want to share with


the the people watching the streams like


what was the reasoning behind


[Music]


um


you know basing these templates off all


like Linux images and then Savannah's


great she's one of the funniest and


coolest people to talk but she basically


was like honestly Linux is where the


people is at so that's super


straightforward I was like I'm gonna use


that exactly because it was it's just


the truth it's like you know we'll see a


couple more stats about uh why like


that's sort of like back up the


statement at first but I'm gonna do this


deployment first because it's probably


gonna take a while


um oh look at this WSL which is Linux on


on Windows
and then we're gonna make deer we're


gonna call this Howlin next Works demo


and then we're gonna CD into this lovely


directory name yeah love it uh and then


we'll just do azd up


and we're gonna call this


which is called reactor demo

talk about these things with than


himself so hey Richard how you doing


I'm doing good I'm doing good and I


guess most of the people no one says is


the duo right the cloud Duo so we do a


lot together yeah yeah


um yeah we are back


um and I think this is my first reactor


stream for this year


oh wow I'm I'm honored yeah you do uh no


you take out with the reactor too as


well rishab does a whole bunch of other


stuff now with me


um but yeah for today uh I want to dive


a little bit more onto Linux on Azure


we're going to talk a little bit more


about Open Source and then the history


of Open Source at Microsoft which was


pretty interesting to read about


um but we're gonna keep these things at


high level then we're gonna talk a


little bit more about utilizing Linux on


Azure then we're gonna demo a little bit


about uh again showcasing our use of


Linux on Azure and then also I want to


actually I'm gonna do this right now


because this might take a while so are


you all familiar with the Azure


developer CLI Azure developer seal I


don't know if anyone's used it before


um also I just got access to the the


Bing chat thing with uh open AI nice so


freaking cool anyway


um so the Azure developer CLI is it's a


CLI that will enable you to essentially


deploy full-on


production ready applications to Azure


with a simple command and they have a


bunch of templates I asked um Savannah


who is the PM for the Azure developer


CLI because I know a lot of their


templates are I want to open up one of


these templates a lot of their templates


are based off of like Linux images so if


we look on like sushi sharp I know the


these app service ones are based off


Linux images and I know the one for the


c-sharp and Azure functions is also


because I helped author that one but


they also have like Java and OJ node.js


Python and I want to pick I don't know


let's pick this Java one as an example


it's off based off container apps and I


asked her like well so what was the


reasoning or can you give me like a


statement because I want to share with


the the people watching the streams like


what was the reasoning behind


[Music]


um


you know basing these templates off all


like Linux images and then Savannah's


great she's one of the funniest and


coolest people to talk but she basically


was like honestly Linux is where the


people is at so that's super


straightforward I was like I'm gonna use


that exactly because it was it's just


the truth it's like you know we'll see a


couple more stats about uh why like


that's sort of like back up the


statement at first but I'm gonna do this


deployment first because it's probably


gonna take a while


um oh look at this WSL which is Linux on


on Windows
and then we're gonna make deer we're


gonna call this Howlin next Works demo


and then we're gonna CD into this lovely


directory name yeah love it uh and then


we'll just do azd up


and we're gonna call this


which is called reactor demo

thank you so much Albina as always for


the wonderful introduction hi everyone I


see a couple people in the chat hanging


out with us already awesome let us know


where you are checking in uh also do let


me know if you are on our our session


last week where we talked all about how


Linux works and today we're going to


take it a step further and talk a little


bit about more about utilizing Linux on


Azure and I have my friend rishab here


he he wasn't on the


let's switch to this so he wasn't on the


um


like the series information or the page


or when you register you probably didn't


see his name because last minute I was


like I really want to talk about uh an


app that we have in production that is


utilizing Linux and it's on Azure and


it's an effort by both of us it's called


learn a cloud some of you may or may not


have heard of it so no one better than


talk about these things with than


himself so hey Richard how you doing


I'm doing good I'm doing good and I


guess most of the people no one says is


the duo right the cloud Duo so we do a


lot together yeah yeah


um yeah we are back


um and I think this is my first reactor


stream for this year


oh wow I'm I'm honored yeah you do uh no


you take out with the reactor too as


well rishab does a whole bunch of other


stuff now with me


um but yeah for today uh I want to dive


a little bit more onto Linux on Azure


we're going to talk a little bit more


about Open Source and then the history


of Open Source at Microsoft which was


pretty interesting to read about


um but we're gonna keep these things at

about uh again showcasing our use of

actually I'm gonna do this right now
